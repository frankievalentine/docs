Sometimes, when writing docs, you wish you knew just a little bit about the person reading them. Maybe you only want to show them the information they should care about. Maybe you want to craft examples that they can use out-of-the-box.

With Mintlify, you can add User Auth to identify your users and tailor your docs content to them.

## What is User Auth

User Auth allows you to configure a method for identifying and authenticating your users. Once authenticated, you can share user-specific information that can be used to personalize the docs. This unlocks some powerful features:

1. **Customize MDX content** with a user's information, such as their title or plan.
2. **Prefill API keys** in the API Playground for streamlined use.
3. **Selectively show pages** in the navigation based on a user's groups.

## What *isn't* User Auth

At this time, User Auth cannot provide any of the following:

1. **Private docs content.** While you can hide pages from unauthenticated users, those pages are still accessible by anyone who can guess the URL. If your documentation contains sensitive information, User Auth is not enough to hide it.
2. **A Mintlify-backed user database.** Mintlify does not store *any* information about your users. Rather, it relies on your existing infrastructure to serve as the source-of-truth for user data.
