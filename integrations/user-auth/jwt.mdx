title: 'JWT Auth'
description: 'Use a customized login flow to authenticate users'
---

If you don’t have a dashboard, or if you want to keep your dashboard and docs completely separate, you can use your own login flow to send user info to your docs via a JWT in the URL.

## Prerequisites

None

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a private key">
    Go to your [Mintlify dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/integrations) and generate a private key. Store this key somewhere secure where it can be accessed by your backend.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a login flow">
    Create a login flow that does the following:
    - Authenticate the user
    - Create a JWT containing the authenticated user's info in the [User Info](./user-info) shape prescribed by Mintlify
    - Sign the JWT with the secret
    - Create a redirect URL back to your docs, including the JWT as a query parameter with the name `user_auth`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your User Auth settings">
    Return to your [Mintlify dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/integrations) and add the login URL to your User Auth settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pros & Cons

Pros:

- No dashboard needed
- Small amount of setup required
- Reduced risk of API endpoint abuse
- Zero additional CORS configuration

Cons:

- Dashboard sessions and docs authentication are completely decoupled, so users will need to log in to your dashboard and your docs separately
- Every time you want to refresh user data, your users must re-login to your docs
  - If your users' data changes frequently, you must require your users to log in frequently or risk having stale data in the docs
  - If your users' data rarely changes, this shouldn't be a problem

## Example

I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `docs.foo.com`. I want my docs to be completely separate from my dashboard (or I don’t have a dashboard at all).

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I go to my Mintlify dashboard and generate a JWT secret. I create a web URL `https://foo.com/docs-login` that initiates a login flow for my users. At the end of this login flow, once I have verified the identity of the user, I create a JWT containing the user’s custom data according to Mintlify’s specification. I sign this JWT with my Mintlify secret, create a redirect URL of the form `https://docs.foo.com?user_auth={SIGNED_JWT}`, and redirect the user.

I then go to the Mintlify dashboard settings and enter `https://foo.com/docs-login` for the Login URL field.
